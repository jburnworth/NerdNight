# Group Project Ideas

- Some sort of API we could host somewhere and make other projects that interact with it.  Maybe like Tyler's Nerd night location picker.
- a local network, self hosted chat app.  Jacob as explored this idea.  Something real low level, open some sockets, share some memory and write messages back and forth.
